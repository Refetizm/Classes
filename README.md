# FLY TO MASOMO
This is my first game in the cocos game engine. You can use the codes in the game as you wish. I designed some of the materials in the game myself. I got the rest from free content on the internet. I got all the music and sound effects from the free samples on the internet. I made the game in a very short time, therefore the codes are very irregular. In the next update you will find the codes arranged. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at refetizm@gmail.com.
